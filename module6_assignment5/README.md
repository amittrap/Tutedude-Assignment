# Assignment 5: Module 6 - Data Structures and Strings in Python

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This assignment focuses on using Pythonâ€™s core data structures â€” **dictionaries** and **lists** â€” along with string operations and user interaction. It includes two tasks:

- Creating and querying a dictionary of student marks.
- Demonstrating list slicing and manipulation techniques.

---

## âœ… Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

### Description

The program performs the following operations:

1. Initializes a dictionary with student names as keys and their marks as values.
2. Prompts the user to enter a studentâ€™s name.
3. Searches for the name in the dictionary:
   - If found, displays the studentâ€™s marks.
   - If not found, displays a message stating that the student is not in the record.

### Functionality

- Demonstrates how to use dictionaries for data storage and retrieval.
- Handles user input and conditionally displays output based on key lookup.

## âœ… Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

### Description

The program demonstrates list slicing by:

1. Creating a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Extracting the first five elements using list slicing.
3. Reversing the extracted elements.
4. Printing both the extracted list and the reversed list.

### Functionality

- Shows how to use slice notation to access specific parts of a list.
- Uses slicing to reverse a list segment.
- Reinforces Python list operations and indexing.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

- `task1_student_marks.py`: Contains the code for Task 1.
- `task2_list_slicing.py`: Contains the code for Task 2.
- `README.md`: This documentation file explaining the purpose and behavior of both programs.

## ðŸ“Œ How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run each task individually using the command line or a Python IDE:

```bash
python task1_student_marks.py
python task2_list_slicing.py
