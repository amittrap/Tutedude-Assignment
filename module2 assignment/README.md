# Assignment 1 - Basic Python Concepts

This assignment covers **Module 2: Basic Python Concepts**.  
It includes two tasks to demonstrate user input, mathematical operations, string manipulation, and formatted output in Python.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

### Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2. Performs the following mathematical operations:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division
3. Displays the results of each operation on the screen.

### Functionality
- The program accepts **two numbers** (integers or decimals).
- Performs **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**.
- Handles **division by zero** gracefully by showing a message instead of crashing.
- Outputs results in a **clear formatted style**.
