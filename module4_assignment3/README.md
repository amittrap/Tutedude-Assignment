# Assignment 3 - Functions in Python

This assignment covers **Module 4: Functions in Python**.  
It includes two tasks that demonstrate the use of **user-defined functions** and the **math module**.

## ðŸ“Œ Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

### Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop (or recursion).
2. Returns the calculated factorial.
3. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

### Functionality
- Uses a **user-defined function** `factorial(n)`.
- Multiplies all numbers from **1 to n**.
- Returns the final result.
- Prints the factorial for a sample number (e.g., `5`).

## ðŸ“Œ Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

### Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Asks the user for a number as input.
2. Uses the **math module** to calculate:
   - Square root of the number
   - Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
   - Sine of the number (in radians)
3. Displays the calculated results.

### Functionality
- Imports the **math module**.
- Calculates:
  - `math.sqrt(num)` â†’ Square root  
  - `math.log(num)` â†’ Natural log (only for positive numbers)  
  - `math.sin(num)` â†’ Sine in radians  
- Handles invalid log inputs (0 or negative).
